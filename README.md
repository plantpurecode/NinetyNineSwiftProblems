This project depends on Xcode and XCTest, but forgoes any other dependencies.

The problem currently being solved can be located in the `current-problem` file.

If I have skipped any problems, they are listed in the `skipped-problems` file.

If you'd like to make a contribution, I don't recommend contributing to this repo. Use [@eneko](http;//github.com/eneko)'s repo instead, [located here](https://github.com/eneko/Ninety-Nine-Swift-Solutions)
